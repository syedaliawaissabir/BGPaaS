Brantley Harris wrote this plugin. It is based somewhat on the JSON.org
website's http://www.json.org/json2.js, which proclaims:
"NO WARRANTY EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.", a sentiment that
I uphold.

It is also influenced heavily by MochiKit's serializeJSON, which is
copyrighted 2005 by Bob Ippolito.
