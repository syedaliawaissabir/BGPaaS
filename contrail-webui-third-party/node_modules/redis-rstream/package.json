  "readme": "# redis-rstream\n\nredis-rstream is a node.js redis read stream which streams binary or utf8 data in chunks from a redis key using an existing redis client. (streams2) Tested with mranney/node_redis client.\n\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/jeffbski/redis-rstream.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/jeffbski/redis-rstream)\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nnpm install redis-rstream\n```\n\nYou will also need the `redis` client (`npm install redis`) or other compatible library. You an also optionally install `hiredis` along with `redis` for additional performance.\n\n## Usage\n\n - `redisRStream(client, key, [options])` - Construct a read stream instance by passing in `client`, redis `key`, and options. Be sure to enable an option in your redis client to return Buffers for the data, like `detect_buffers: true` so that binary data will be read properly. The default `options.chunkSize` (the size of the data packets in the stream) is 64KB, this is ignored if using the streams2 read(chunkSize) since the provided chunkSize will be used instead. You can limit how many pending reads are allowed for this read stream, by specifying `options.maxPendingReads` which defaults to 2.\n\n```javascript\nvar redis = require('redis');\nvar redisRStream = require('redis-rstream'); // factory\nvar client = redis.createClient(null, null, {detect_buffers: true}); // create client using your options and auth\nredisRStream(client, 'keyToStreamFrom')  // create instance of read stream w/default 64KB chunk size\n  .pipe(...)\n```\n\nTested with mranney/node_redis client, but should work with any client that implements:\n\n - `getrange(key, start, stop, cb)` - where key is a Buffer and the data returned is a Buffer\n\n\n## Goals\n\n - Simple read stream which can use existing redis client (and especially mranney/node_redis)\n - Remove all the complexity of managing a stream and reading in chunks from a redis key\n - Create normal pausable node.js read stream which can be piped or used as any other stream\n - uses streams2 from node 0.10+, but is also compatible with 0.8\n\n## Why\n\nmranney/node_redis does not have direct ability to read a key as a stream, so rather than writing this logic again and again, wrap this up into a read stream so we simply point it to a key and it streams.\n\nOther redis stream implementations use their own direct network connections to redis, but I would prefer to use an existing connection for all my redis work which makes authentication and things lke failover easier to deal with.\n\n## Get involved\n\nIf you have input or ideas or would like to get involved, you may:\n\n - contact me via twitter @jeffbski  - <http://twitter.com/jeffbski>\n - open an issue on github to begin a discussion - <https://github.com/jeffbski/redis-rstream/issues>\n - fork the repo and send a pull request (ideally with tests) - <https://github.com/jeffbski/redis-rstream>\n\n## License\n\n - [MIT license](http://github.com/jeffbski/redis-rstream/raw/master/LICENSE)\n\n",
