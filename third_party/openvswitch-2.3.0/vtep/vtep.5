.SH "TABLE RELATIONSHIPS"
.PP
The following diagram shows the relationship among tables in the
database.  Each node represents a table.  Tables that are part of the
``root set'' are shown with double borders.  Each edge leads from the
table that contains it and points to the table that its value
represents.  Edges are labeled with their column names, followed by a
constraint on the number of allowed values: \fB?\fR for zero or one,
\fB*\fR for zero or more, \fB+\fR for one or more.  Thick lines
represent strong references; thin lines represent weak references.

.SS "Details:
.IP "\fBlocal\fR: \fBPhysical_Locator\fR"
Tunnel end-point local to the physical switch.
.IP "\fBremote\fR: \fBPhysical_Locator\fR"
Tunnel end-point remote to the physical switch.
.ST "Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD):"
BFD, defined in RFC 5880, allows point to point detection of
connectivity failures by occasional transmission of BFD control
messages. VTEPs are expected to implement BFD.
.PP
BFD operates by regularly transmitting BFD control messages at a
rate negotiated independently in each direction.  Each endpoint
specifies the rate at which it expects to receive control messages,
and the rate at which it\(cqs willing to transmit them.  An endpoint
which fails to receive BFD control messages for a period of three
times the expected reception rate will signal a connectivity
fault.  In the case of a unidirectional connectivity issue, the
system not receiving BFD control messages will signal the problem
to its peer in the messages it transmits.
.PP
A hardware VTEP is expected to use BFD to determine reachability of
devices at the end of the tunnels with which it exchanges data. This
can enable the VTEP to choose a functioning service node among a set of
service nodes providing high availability. It also enables the NVC to
report the health status of tunnels.
.PP
In most cases the BFD peer of a hardware VTEP will be an Open vSwitch
instance. The Open vSwitch implementation of BFD aims to comply
faithfully with the requirements put forth in RFC 5880.  Open vSwitch
does not implement the optional Authentication or ``Echo Mode\(cq\(cq
features.
.ST "BFD Local Configuration:"
The HSC writes the key-value pairs in the
\fBbfd_config_local\fR column to specifiy the local
configurations to be used for BFD sessions on this tunnel.
.IP "\fBbfd_config_local : bfd_dst_mac\fR: optional string"
Set to an Ethernet address in the form
\fIxx\fR:\fIxx\fR:\fIxx\fR:\fIxx\fR:\fIxx\fR:\fIxx\fR
to set the MAC expected as destination for received BFD packets.
.IP "\fBbfd_config_local : bfd_dst_ip\fR: optional string"
Set to an IPv4 address to set the IP address that is expected as destination
for received BFD packets.  The default is \fB169.254.1.0\fR\.
.ST "BFD Remote Configuration:"
The \fBbfd_config_remote\fR column is the remote
counterpart of the \fBbfd_config_local\fR column.
The NVC writes the key-value pairs in this column.
.IP "\fBbfd_config_remote : bfd_dst_mac\fR: optional string"
Set to an Ethernet address in the form
\fIxx\fR:\fIxx\fR:\fIxx\fR:\fIxx\fR:\fIxx\fR:\fIxx\fR
to set the destination MAC to be used for transmitted BFD packets.
The default is \fB00:23:20:00:00:01\fR\.
.IP "\fBbfd_config_remote : bfd_dst_ip\fR: optional string"
Set to an IPv4 address to set the IP address used as destination

.IP "\fBbfd_params : enable\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
True to enable BFD on this tunnel.
.IP "\fBbfd_params : min_rx\fR: optional string, containing an integer, at least 1"
The shortest interval, in milliseconds, at which this BFD session
offers to receive BFD control messages.  The remote endpoint may
choose to send messages at a slower rate.  Defaults to
\fB1000\fR\.
.IP "\fBbfd_params : min_tx\fR: optional string, containing an integer, at least 1"
The shortest interval, in milliseconds, at which this BFD session is
willing to transmit BFD control messages.  Messages will actually be
transmitted at a slower rate if the remote endpoint is not willing to
receive as quickly as specified.  Defaults to \fB100\fR\.
.IP "\fBbfd_params : decay_min_rx\fR: optional string, containing an integer"
An alternate receive interval, in milliseconds, that must be greater
than or equal to \fBbfd:min_rx\fR\.  The
implementation switches from \fBbfd:min_rx\fR to \fBbfd:decay_min_rx\fR when there is no obvious incoming
data traffic at the interface, to reduce the CPU and bandwidth cost
of monitoring an idle interface.  This feature may be disabled by
setting a value of 0.  This feature is reset whenever \fBbfd:decay_min_rx\fR or \fBbfd:min_rx\fR
changes.
.IP "\fBbfd_params : forwarding_if_rx\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
True to consider the interface capable of packet I/O as long as it
continues to receive any packets (not just BFD packets).  This
prevents link congestion that causes consecutive BFD control packets
to be lost from marking the interface down.
.IP "\fBbfd_params : cpath_down\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
Set to true to notify the remote endpoint that traffic should not be
forwarded to this system for some reason other than a connectivty
failure on the interface being monitored.  The typical underlying
reason is ``concatenated path down,\(cq\(cq that is, that connectivity
beyond the local system is down.  Defaults to false.
.IP "\fBbfd_params : check_tnl_key\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
Set to true to make BFD accept only control messages with a tunnel
key of zero.  By default, BFD accepts control messages with any
tunnel key.
.ST "BFD Status:"
The VTEP sets key-value pairs in the \fBbfd_status\fR
column to report the status of BFD on this tunnel.  When BFD is
not enabled, with \fBbfd_params:enable\fR, the
HSC clears all key-value pairs from \fBbfd_status\fR\.
.IP "\fBbfd_status : state\fR: optional string, one of \fBdown\fR, \fBinit\fR, \fBup\fR, or \fBadmin_down\fR"
Reports the state of the BFD session.  The BFD session is fully
healthy and negotiated if \fBUP\fR\.
.IP "\fBbfd_status : forwarding\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
Reports whether the BFD session believes this tunnel
may be used to forward traffic.  Typically this means the local session
is signaling \fBUP\fR, and the remote system isn\(cqt signaling a
problem such as concatenated path down.
.IP "\fBbfd_status : diagnostic\fR: optional string"
In case of a problem, set to a short message that reports what the
local BFD session thinks is wrong.
.IP "\fBbfd_status : remote_state\fR: optional string, one of \fBdown\fR, \fBinit\fR, \fBup\fR, or \fBadmin_down\fR"
Reports the state of the remote endpoint\(cqs BFD session.

Mapping of multicast MAC addresses to tunnels (physical
locators). This table is written by the HSC, so it contains the
MAC addresses that have been learned on physical ports by a
VTEP. These may be learned by IGMP snooping, for example. This
table also specifies how to handle unknown unicast and broadcast packets.

.SH "Mcast_Macs_Remote TABLE"
Mapping of multicast MAC addresses to tunnels (physical
locators). This table is written by the NVC, so it contains the
MAC addresses that the NVC has learned. This
table also specifies how to handle unknown unicast and broadcast
packets.
.PP
Multicast packet replication may be handled by a service node,
in which case the physical locators will be IP addresses of
service nodes. If the VTEP supports replication onto multiple
tunnels, then this may be used to replicate directly onto
VTEP-hyperisor tunnels.

.IP "\fBswitch_binding\fR: map of string-\fBLogical_Switch\fR pairs"
Maps from an IPv4 or IPv6 address prefix in CIDR notation to a
logical switch. Multiple prefixes may map to the same switch. By
writing a 32-bit (or 128-bit for v6) address with a /N prefix
length, both the router\(cqs interface address and the subnet
prefix can be configured. For example, 192.68.1.1/24 creates a
/24 subnet for the logical switch attached to the interface and
assigns the address 192.68.1.1 to the router interface.
.IP "\fBstatic_routes\fR: map of string-string pairs"
One or more static routes, mapping IP prefixes to next hop IP addresses.

.SH "Arp_Sources_Local TABLE"
MAC address to be used when a VTEP issues ARP requests on behalf
of a logical router.
.PP
A distributed logical router is implemented by a set of VTEPs
(both hardware VTEPs and vswitches). In order for a given VTEP
to populate the local ARP cache for a logical router, it issues
ARP requests with a source MAC address that is unique to the VTEP. A
single per-VTEP MAC can be re-used across all logical
networks. This table contains the MACs that are used by the
VTEPs of a given HSC. The table provides the mapping from MAC to
physical locator for each VTEP so that replies to the ARP
requests can be sent back to the correct VTEP using the
appropriate physical locator.

This table is the remote counterpart of \fBArp_sources_local\fR\. The NVC writes this table to notify
the HSC of the MACs that will be used by remote VTEPs when they
issue ARP requests on behalf of a distributed logical router.

.SH "Physical_Locator TABLE"
Identifies an endpoint to which logical switch traffic may be
encapsulated and forwarded.
.PP
For the \fBvxlan_over_ipv4\fR encapsulation, the only
encapsulation defined so far, all endpoints associated with a given \fBLogical_Switch\fR must use a common tunnel key, which is carried
in the \fBtunnel_key\fR column of \fBLogical_Switch\fR\.
.PP
For some encapsulations yet to be defined, we expect \fBPhysical_Locator\fR to identify both an endpoint and a tunnel key.
When the first such encapsulation is defined, we expect to add a
``tunnel_key\(cq\(cq column to \fBPhysical_Locator\fR to allow the
tunnel key to be defined.
.PP
See the ``Per Logical-Switch Tunnel Key\(cq\(cq section in the \fBLogical_Switch\fR table for further discussion of the model.
