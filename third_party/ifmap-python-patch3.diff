+# NOTE(sahid): It seems that the geventhttpclient uses gevent.queue.LifoQueue
+# to maintain a pool of connections and according to the doc it is possible
+# to configure the maxsize of the queue with None or a value less than 0 to
+# set the number of connections ulimited otherwise It is actually not possible
+# to set it to None or less than 0 since lock.BoundedSemaphore will return an
